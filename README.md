# PocketServerPi
My customized FriendlyArm kernel setup on a Nano Pi Neo Air

## Over all
More or less a backup copy of my NanoPi NeoAir setup that I felt was worth documenting. In a nutshell my setup is (or can be) a portable proftpd, SSH, bluetooth media host, minidlna, Access Point **and** samba server, etc.. for $25.

## Build Materials
* <a href='http://www.friendlyarm.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=151'>NanoPi Neo Air</a>: $17.99 + $8 Shipping<br>
(My total cost after tax, shipping, hardware and a clear acrylic case [recommended for only $3.00] was $28.98)

## Todo
* Create a basic, generalized image (personal passwords/credz removed) so that USB to UART adapter is not needed for setup and can be accessed via SSH, Butterfly, Putty etc...
