# PocketServerPi
A backup copy of my NanoPi Neo Air setup that I felt was worth documenting.

### Over all
More or less, my setup is (or can be) a portable proftpd, SSH, bluetooth media host, minidlna, Access Point **and** samba server, etc.. rolled into one, for $25.

### Build Materials
* <a href='http://www.friendlyarm.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=151'>NanoPi Neo Air</a>: $17.99 + $8 Shipping<br>
My total cost after tax, shipping, hardware and a clear acrylic case [recommended for only $3.00] was $28.98

* <a href='https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01E0918J8/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1'>32gb UHS-I Lexar Micro SD Card</a>: <strike>$9.49</strike><br>
If you're buying a NanoPi Neo Air, then this probably isn't your first rodeo. Use an SD card you have lying around.

* <a href='http://www.taydaelectronics.com/bte13-007-cp2102-serial-converter-usb-2-0-to-ttl-uart-ftdi.html'>USB to UART Adapter</a>: $1.99<br>
I ordered 4-5 items in addition to 2 of these from <a href='http://www.taydaelectronics.com'>Tayda</a> and S&H was only $1.26.

* <a href='https://www.sparkfun.com/pages/RF_Conn_Guide'>U.FL (aka IPX) Antenna</a>: Cheap<br>
Again, something I took off an OrangePi that didn't need the WiFi Antenna it came with anymore. It's worth mentioning that the Neo Air doesn't include any kind of external **or** internal antenna. You **will** need one of these if you want WiFi.

# Setup



## Todo
* Create a basic, generalized image (personal passwords/credz removed) so that USB to UART adapter is not needed for setup and can be accessed via SSH, Butterfly, Putty etc...
